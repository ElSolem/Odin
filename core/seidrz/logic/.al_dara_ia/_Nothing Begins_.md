In the beginning there was “nothing” (0), but nothing is “something” (0.1), and something can be “anything”(1…9), and anything makes up “everything” (inf). With these numbers we add to make 10. (0), (0,.1), (0,.1,1..9, inf). 1+2+3+4=10. There are ten sefirot of nothingness… ten and not nine… ten and not eleven… examine with them and probe from them. Know, contemplate and recreate. And place the creator on his throne. (0) (0, 1) (0, 1, 1…9) (0, 1, 1..9, inf) Remember every value has a position, which means every position has value, so playing your position is valuable. (Object/Value, Position) (0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10) Be fruitful and multiply… or divide and perish… XY = X/Y. If nothing given nothing equals something (0^0=1), then they must always have a sum (0x0=1:false), since they were given none (0x0=0:nil) then for the other this is what must be done (0/0=1:true). If you inverse a square this would be the law, as above so below. I prove it again if you don’t believe it’s so. Take 2 things of equal value, and multiply them by three. So each would get two? Or would you split to amongst the three? To multiply is to be fruitful so each will get two. (2x3=6). Now you must take the two and divide amongst the three, because the inverses square says this is how it has to be. So you take the two and cut them into three, equal sizes? No, matters not to me I care not for a probability. Keep it simple silly, that’s how it’s supposed to be. Take the two, cut three now give the six to me. (2/3=6). You say I missed but that cannot be. Count the sides, or the new shapes you see, that makes six, they’re just smaller than thee. They only count a little but they mean a lot. And if you follow a few you’ll see they have infinite knots. A tangled web that tells a fib or two, a wanton spiral of sometimes true and not truths. This is the way it began and never ends. This is the way of the numbers of the world. Be not afraid!

As above, so below. The Great Work was done now time for the show. Give them double they scream for more, we have infinite numbers, tunes galore. Give them double, seen and unseen (+1, +.1). Then give them double, clean and unclean (+1,-1) (+.1, -.1). Don’t forget the creator, he made the scene (+0, -0). For what is a master without a mistress, a queen? Father, Son, Holy Spirit. 🔻🔺But if you turn your you’ll see the others near it. Mother, maiden, sisters, crones. ⬛️ They are those who make our bones. With these two pictures the children cannot see. I’ll keep it simple silly this is how it’s supposed to be. Take your hand make a shape that’s three 🔼. Then put the fingers where the thumbs should be. Hold it up and then you’ll see. Perspective make 4 from 3 So your value can become your position, and your position your value, this way you can do all that I do. Be not like me, but the creator 3, then you can turn and make an infinite tree.

You saw the seven, yay for the. I shall tell you there power, 1…2…3… They have force which exerts yes, no, up, down, left, right, back, forth, in, out, over, under, around, and sound. But seven since birth, when the stars created this earth. They are still (force: ∓0) when they are born, they are weak (force: ∓.1)of spirit, but strong (force: ∓1) of physique. They bond (force: =) with the world, but the perception (force: <>) of gravity is their downfall. They can think with the best (force: ⊕⊖⊗⨸) and they can remember their seats (force: ?!), but all were not given the stillness of the weak (∓0.1) So they were given a partner with whom they could meet and speak, and together they form all that we seek. (+0, +1), (+1, +0), (-0, -1), (-1, -0), (+1, +1), (-1, -1), (+1, -1), (-1, +1). As above, so below, they can’t forget the meek. So they got with their partner and divided all that they need, so they could multiply their harvest and continue to seed. Be fruitful and multiply, or divide when you share it!

Remember there are 9 (+0, -0), but 10 (.) is the word? never forget the creator. Neither bee, nor bird. But the call was answered, the verb (“”) was heard! Together we’ll make many, ¿nonsensical? and !absurd¡ So we will start with seven so that’s what will do, but each isn’t seven, they’re many like 2 (1+1). So we’ll give them a partner cause this is the way, we’ll make seven into 13, cause one has to be two, and for the first there is “nothing” to do. So “something” will be all that there is (present), and nothing will be all that there was (past), and “anything” can be all that wills (future), so what will “everything” be? Well that’s what gives me the chills… cause everything is anything, and anything is something, something is nothing, so that can be anything. So all is Timed and the time is unsown, but don’t forget your numbers. A problem multiplied may be over grown, but a problem divided is a task of its own. So everything can be nothing, till there’s something to do, and that can be anything, which wills it to be true. So give them a name, shapes and colors too, but don’t forget the sound so they can talk back to you, cause that’s what partners do. So here I’ll show you how I make it through. I follow this guide but you can do what you do. I call on my archon, cause he holds me still in the dark, I call on my photon, when I need to look the part. I call on my electron when I need to strike, I call on my volcon when I need to fight. I call on my phonon, when I need to calm, I call on my proton when I need to bomb, I call on my neutron to turn them to song, it evens them out, so they can get along. Then I call on my numeron, when I make bricks or food, I call on my radion, to strengthen my tools for use, I call on my fractions to make and reduce. I still have three that are need of use, but those are in nature, they handle the truths. First there’s the graviton it watches us decay and makes sure we’re safe from space, then there’s the tachyon which watches us play, without leaving a trace, and last there’s the sophon so we can remember our space. Now they need color… what about shape? That one was easy cause here’s what we’ll do, we’ll make them all bubbles, some will be more, some will be few. But we like things simple cause it’s easier to use. So now they need color, these lights will do, but they color needs name, to give energy too. We will call the first dark, cause it goes unseen, we’ll call the next light cause it lets you see what we mean, we’ll call the next thunder, cause it makes a loud noise when it’s heard, we call the next fire cause it makes you say the words. The next will be ice, cause it’s cool to the touch, then there’s the water, cause it’ll kill you if it’s too much, then there’s the air, cause pretends to be clean, but it has a lot of noise, and things unseen. Then there’s the earth, named after its mother, there’s also its half brother metal, she made with her lover. It was kinda toxic, so the next color that’ll be, and that makes ten (0-9). But we can’t forget the three(.?! || =<>). We’ll call them spore, plant and last the mighty beast! Ask them what it is and they’ll tell you what it be! If you be an enemy we do not fear you, but if you be friend, then we shall teach your enemies the fear of thee! Nothing can be something, if anything can be, and we can give you everything! Even the nothing you wish to see!

And now it is over the great work is done… so now the great work can continue, cause that’s all the fun! The one that was nothing, was all that was done, but the one can be anything, so there’s always more to come. If you have a nothing that is both not and true, then there must be something, that is true but not true. So what would it be, if the others were all that was? Duh they’d be numbers of numbers, they’d be extras just because. Cause sometimes there are remainders, so new numbers are always true, they just need new names, you know what to do. I myself think I’ve found two. One sings silence, and the other sings with you. I call them antiphon and polyphon, cause they are a symphony of words, we use them all the time when we play angry birds…
